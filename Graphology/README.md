# Graphology

In this project i have used 

1. **Open CV** for image processing

2. **Machine learning model svm** to detect features of the hand written images after preprocessing 

3. I got higher accuracy when i used linear kernel in svm 

  The accuracies are shown below

    Accuracy for Predicting  **Emotion** :  0.9989795918367347

    Accuracy for Predicting  **mental** :  0.823469387755102

    Accuracy for Predicting  **modesty** :  0.8112244897959183

    Accuracy for Predicting  **discipline** :  0.9989795918367347

    Accuracy for Predicting  **communication** :  0.8816326530612245

    Accuracy for Predicting  **social** :  0.9908163265306122

4. And then i have use **Flask , Html and CSS** to built a Web app

5. Used **Heroku** to deploy the website

6. If u want to fork the git hub then fork it or Download it 

    then open app.py file in vscode or any editor with **python** installed

    then open terminal and type the command **"pip install -r requirements"** to install all requirements in your python environment.

    To Run the application use command **"python app.py"**

    then open Your **localhost:5000** to see test the application
